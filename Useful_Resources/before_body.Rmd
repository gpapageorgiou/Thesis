\textit{Like the psychologists the physical scientist has to construe the world, and this business of construing in highly problematic. The world does not lie there before the scientist in ready-labelled pens and pre-constructed hierarchies: the scientist must start with a priori assumptions. The more philosophically sound these assumptions are the more empirically fruitful the work will be.}
